This is a collection of bots I have programmed for use with [Robocode Tank Royale](https://github.com/robocode-dev/tank-royale).

Currently included is:
* **MyFirstBot**: A modified version of the bot created in the official [MyFirstBot tutorial](https://robocode-dev.github.io/tank-royale/tutorial/my-first-bot.html). It repeatedly moves backward and forwards. It also searches for and tracks targets, similarly to the sample bot "TrackFire." It will also try to face at a 90-degree angle to incoming bullets so it can dodge them. If it gets too close to a targeted bot it will attempt to move away.
